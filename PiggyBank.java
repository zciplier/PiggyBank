/*
 * This project is made by @zciplier on the date of 9/18/2022
 * This program gets the user's input of whether they have a cent, dime, nickel, or a quarter
 * and multiplies it by the price of the value and adds it to the money variable to get the total
 * and then prints it to console.
 * This uses a while loop to continue the loop while the button "NO" is not pressed.
